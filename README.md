# Supreme Bread Bakery

## Command-line Inventory CRUD Application Project

This is a CRUD command-line application for a bakery called **Supreme Bread Bakery**. Employees can keep track of the inventory of the bakery. Employees can create new breads, update breads, see a list of all breads, see details of one bread and delete breads.

A unique **ID** will be assigned to each new bread created. This **ID** can then be used to show a specific bread in the inventory with all its details, to update any of the desired details or delete a specific bread from the inventory.
